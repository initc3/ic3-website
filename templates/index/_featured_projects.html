<div class="">
    <p>
          Liquefaction, a wallet platform that challenges the traditional assumption that private keys and assets are controlled solely by individuals. By using trusted execution environments (TEEs), Liquefaction attaches multi-user policies to private keys, allowing cryptocurrency credentials and assets to be rented, shared, or pooled without leaving on-chain traces. This approach can disrupt the security and economic models of various applications, such as DAO voting and airdrops, while also offering benefits like privacy-preserving DAOs and countermeasures to dusting attacks. The authors highlight the need to rethink key and asset ownership models in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
