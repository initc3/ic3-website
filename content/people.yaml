He is interested in increasing the digital trust of online information and processes, especially those that impact the physical world. He focuses on scalability of blockchains, being the first to introduce quorum-based permissionless blockchains (Byzcoin) and permissionless sharding protocols (OmniLedger) as well as structured Mempools (Narwhal). His work is the first to break the 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000 transactions per second barriers. He is also interested in how to produce secure distributed randomness and setup private vaults that enable private data exchange over blockchains. For his work he has been awarded the IBM PhD Fellowship for 2018 and 2019, and the EPFL Thesis Distinction 2020."
