# IC3 Impact & Accomplishments

In addition to our scholarship, IC3 has been extremely active in the open source crypto and blockchain communities for several years - with many significant contributions; and by any objective measure, far more than any other academic group. Below is a partial list with some references and press.

## Coins and Chains

- *Bitcoin*: IC3 scholars identified a fundamental limitation of proof-of-work consensus protocols known as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3212998">selfish mining</a>; invented <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-53357-4_9">covenants and vaults</a> to keep coins secure at rest; and their work on characterizing the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/eyal">scalability</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03998">decentralization</a> of proof-of-work blockchains played a fundamental role in Bitcoin's block size debate. IC3 continues to operate the <a href="https://www.falcon-net.org">Falcon relay network</a> to help decentralization.
- *Ethereum*: IC3 researchers played a role in identifying reentrancy hazards in smart contracts; IC3 researchers issued a call for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03998">moratorium on The DAO</a> prior to the hack, one of which the DAO hacker used; IC3's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05812.pdf">Sprites</a> is now included in Raiden.
- *Bitcoin Cash*: IC3's <a href="https://www.falcon-net.org">Falcon relay network</a> also powers the Bitcoin Cash network and helps ferry blocks and transactions to create an equal playing field for all miners.
- *Monero*: IC3's <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-transactions-history-can-be-revealed-and-exposed-research">Monerolink</a> work led to multiple improvements to improve privacy provided by Monero's ring sampling procedure, remote nodes vulnerability disclosure. 
- *Hyperledger*: IC3 is a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/05/22/blockchain-moves-ahead-with-nasdaq-citi-platform-hyperledger-and-ethereum-growth/#277cefa07333">founding member</a> of Hyperledger, and IC3 researchers are currently porting HoneyBadgerBFT consensus protocol to the platform. 
- *Waves*: Core consensus mechanism is <a href="https://www.usenix.org/node/194907">Bitcoin NG</a>, invented at IC3. Waves derives <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/11/08/waves-set-to-become-fastest-decentralized-blockchain-platform-globally/#291e66d038b6">its performance from NG</a>.
- *Aeternity*: Core consensus mechanism is <a href="https://hackingdistributed.com/2015/10/14/bitcoin-ng/">Bitcoin NG</a>, invented at IC3. 
- *Zcoin, BitMessage*: These systems use <a href="https://zcoin.io/what-is-dandelion-and-how-it-can-improve-zcoins-privacy/">Dandelion</a>, invented at IC3, for their <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/anatomy-anonymity-how-dandelion-could-make-bitcoin-more-private/">strong privacy guarantees</a>.
- *Qtum, PIVX, Particl, 20 others*: IC3's work on "fake stake" attacks has led to improvements in all of these systems.
