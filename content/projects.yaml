    name: 'Solidus: Confidential Financial Transaction Settlement on a Distributed Ledgers'
    challenges: [*scaling, *confidentiality]
    description: Solidus is a cryptocurrency (&quot;blockchain&quot;) that can be run by a confederation or consortium of trustworthy entities-- -banks, governments, auditors, etc. While it retains some of the benefits of decentralization, Solidus offers higher performance and tighter governance and control than existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Many successful peer-to- peer technologies have historically been eclipsed or supplanted by centralized or commercial systems (e.g., in the online music industry). Solidus addresses the possibility and desire by many financial institutions that cryptocurrencies and contracts will follow a similar path.

    name: 'Bitcoin-NG: A Next-generation Blockchain Protocol'
    challenges: [*scaling]
    description: Bitcoin-NG is a new protocol pioneered by IC3. It addresses the scalability bottleneck of Bitcoin by enabling the Bitcoin network to achieve the highest throughput allowed by the network conditions. Paradoxically, not only does it improve transaction throughput, it also reduces transaction latencies -- it is possible to get an initial transaction confirmation in seconds rather than in minutes. And it does so without changing Bitcoin’s open architecture and trust model. Our blockchain test bed Miniature World simulated Bitcoin-NG at 15% the size of the operational Bitcoin system, where we showed that Bitcoin–NG is only limited by the network.

    name: "Fruitchain: A new Approach for Incentive Compatible Blockchains"
    challenges: [*scaling]
    description: Most of today's blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are not "incentive compatible", meaning they are quite vulnerable to strategic gaming by dishonest adversaries. For example, IC3 has proven that the Bitcoin blockchain can be compromised by miners or mining pools with much less than 50% of the mining hash power. Fruitchain is an innovative blockchain methodology that discourages dishonest gaming, by making it extremely unprofitable for an adversary with less than 50% of the hash power, achieving an epsilon-equilibrium or near-Nash equilibrium.

    name: "FLAC: A Calculus for Flow-Limited Authorization"
    challenges: [*correctness]
    description: Real-world applications routinely make authorization decisions based on dynamic computation. Integrity of the system might be compromised if attackers can improperly influence the authorizing computation. Confidentiality can also be compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC) is both a simple, expressive model for reasoning about dynamic authorization and also a language for securely implementing various authorization mechanisms. FLAC provides strong end-to- end information security guarantees even for programs that incorporate and implement rich dynamic authorization mechanisms. For more info, please see the presentation by Professor Andrew Myers “Verifying Information Security of Code in Dynamic Systems” at our <a href="http://www.initc3.org/events/2016-05-17-IC3-Retreat-2016.html">2016 IC3 Retreat (https://tinyurl.com/ic3retreat)</a> in NYC.

    name: "Theoretical Foundations for Secure Decentralized Systems"
    challenges: [*correctness]
    description: This work explores the theoretical basis for the security and stability of open decentralized systems. The benefits of decentralization include resistance to many kinds of attacks, diversity, and diffusion of power. The novelty and inspiring success of Bitcoin has provided new evidence that secure decentralized systems are more feasible than once thought. On the other hand, even Bitcoin risks becoming centralized if thrown off-balance, e.g. due to mining pools, ASIC farms, or political schisms. Furthermore, IC3 and collaborators just released a research paper that analyzed The Digital Autonomous Organization (DAO) and its voting mechanism. This paper identifies problems with The DAO&#39;s mechanism design that incentivize investors to behave strategically; that is, at odds with truthful voting on their preferences. We then outline potential attacks against The DAO made possible by these behaviors.

     name: "Town Crier: Authenticated Data Feeds for Smart Contracts"
     challenges: [*confidentiality, *adf, *migration]
     description: In order to reason about the real world, smart contracts in cryptocurrency systems will rely on informational input from what we call authenticated data feeds (ADFs); such information can include stock prices, meteorological reports, news, and other current events. It is therefore important that an ADF be trustworthy, in the sense of providing security against manipulation by an attacker attempting to influence the outcome of a contract. By utilizing trusted hardware to provide reliable, digitally signed attestations on data to client contracts, the Town Crier system can serve as a trustworthy ADF under minimal trust assumptions about its operator.

     name: "EtherScrape: A Complementary Block Explorer for the Ethereum Blockchain"
     challenges: [*adf]
     description: Smart Contracts in Ethereum are written in a high-level programming language (typically Serpent or Solidity) and then compiled down to bytecode for the Ethereum virtual machine. This compilation step removes a lot of the useful information found in the high level source code, such as comments, names of variables, etc. If you can identify the high-level source code for a contract, you have a better chance of figuring out what it does. EtherScrape uses fingerprinting to match each smart contract on the blockchain (that is, the compiled bytecode) to the high-level source code that created it.

     name: "Gyges: Crime in Decentralized Smart Contracts "
     challenges: [*compliance]
     description: Two of the most widely desired goals for &quot;Bitcoin 2.0&quot; are privacy and more expressive smart contracts. Many uses of cryptocurrency have a clear and legitimate need for privacy (e.g., financial service companies are expected to protect the privacy of their clients&#39; transactions). General purpose smart contract programming frameworks make it easy to tinker, prototype, and search for the next &quot;killer application&quot; for cryptocurrencies. These two directions seem to be at odds with each other; however, through the use of sophisticated cryptography (like zero knowledge proofs and multi-party computation), we explore how to achieve both goals at once.

     description: This project revisits the selfish mining (SM) strategy in two ways. First, we present a modified SM strategy, convert selfish mining, that, perplexingly, is more profitable than Nakamoto even when the attacker performs no selfish mining after a difficulty adjustment. This strategy has the added benefit that it is even harder to detect than pure SM, and may additionally increase token value through deflation. Second, we analyze the profitability of SM under several difficulty adjustment schemes.

     name: "Saber"
     challenges: [*correctness, *scaling] 
     description: This project proposes the paradigm for parallel and asynchronous smart contract execution. Our paradigm distinguishes between consensus nodes and execution nodes. It allows different groups of execution nodes to execute transactions in parallel, and meanwhile, consensus nodes can continue ordering transactions and processing execution results in a non-blocking way. Due to our new dispute resolution strategy, it (empirically) only requires 10 execution nodes in each group. Moreover, it requires no coordination among execution nodes and can effectively prevent livelocks.

     name: "Avalanche"
     challenges: [*scaling]
     description: BFT consensus used by cryptocurrencies consists of two families, traditional consensus and Nakamoto's consensus. The former is usually leader-based, quadratic in message complexity. It requires precise membership knowledge, and suffers from leader bottleneck as it scales up in size. While the latter does not require membership, it is poor in performance and wasteful in energy due to PoW. This project proposes the third, new category of consensus protocols that is PoW-free, leader-less, committee-less, permission-less. It exerts the powerful meta-stability inspired by epidemic protocols, and operators as fast as the network propagates.
