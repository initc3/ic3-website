    name: 'Clockwork Finance: Automated Analysis of Economic Security in Smart Contracts'
    challenges: [*correctness]
    description: Clockwork Finance Framework (CFF) is a general purpose, formal verification framework for mechanized reasoning about the economic security properties of composed decentralized-finance (DeFi) smart contracts. CFF features three key properties. It is contract complete, meaning that it can model any smart contract platform and all its contracts---Turing complete or otherewise. It does so with asymptotically optimal model size. It is also attack-exhaustive by construction, meaning that it can automatically and mechanically extract all possible economic attacks on users' cryptocurrency across modeled contracts. Thanks to these properties, CFF can support multiple goals: economic security analysis of contracts by developers, analysis of DeFi trading risks by users, and optimization of arbitrage opportunities by bots or miners. Because CFF offers composability, it can support these goals with reasoning over any desired set of potentially interacting smart contract models. We instantiate CFF as an executable model for Ethereum contracts that incorporates a state-of-the-art deductive verifier. Building on previous work, we introduce extractable value (EV), a new formal notion of economic security in composed DeFi contracts that is both a basis for CFF analyses and of general interest. We construct modular, human-readable, composable CFF models of four popular, deployed DeFi protocols in Ethereum: Uniswap, Uniswap V2, Sushiswap, and MakerDAO, representing a combined 17 billion USD in value as of August 2021. We used these models to show experimentally that CFF is practical and can drive useful, data-based insights from real world transaction activity. Without any explicitly programmed attack strategies, CFF uncovers on average an expected $56 million of EV per month in the recent past.

     name: 'CanDID: Can-Do Decentralized Identity with Legacy Compatibility, Sybil-Resistance, and Accountability'
     challenges: [*confidentiality, *compliance]
     description: CanDID is a platform for practical, user-friendly realization of decentralized identity, the idea of empowering end users with management of their own credentials. While decentralized identity promises to give users greater control over their private data, it burdens users with management of private keys, creating a significant risk of key loss. Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy. CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized commitee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user's keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identites and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users.

     name: 'MAD-HTCL - Because HTCL is Crazy-Cheap to Attack'
     challenges: [*correctness, *compliance]
     description: Smart contracts and transactions allow users to implement elaborate constructions on cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Libra. Many of these, including operational payment channels, use a building block called Hased Time-Locked Contract (HTLC). In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLCSpec), and present an implementation called Mutual-Assured-Distruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract (MAD-HTCL). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing blockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user misbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all their funds. We prove that MAD-HTLC satisfies HTLC-Spec with game-theoretic analysis and instantiate it on Bitcoin's operational blockchain. Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue, since the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other revenue components shrink, miners are motivated to fully optimize their fund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such an optimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of MAD-HTLC. Finally, we show how vulerable HTLC is to bribery attacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer their transactions by offering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this can be easily implemented by patching Bitcoin client, and use game theoretic tools to qualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks.

     name: 'AIRS: Automated Incentives for Reforestation Stewardship'
     challenges: [*good]
     description: The accelerating effect of global climate change is a major challenge for humanity. One critical component of any comprehensive solution is reforestation. As large and effective carbon sinks, forests are important to both conserve and expand. Not all types of forest, though, are equally effective at carbon sequestration. To create, monitor, and manage effective reforestation programs, it is essential that we be able to measure forest carbon accurately and with high geospatial precision. Our project will build infrastructure that, (1) Provides an accurate and trustworthy source of data on forest carbon and (2) Implements a system of automated monetary rewards for local inhabitants to conserve and/or increase forests that effectively reduce carbon emissions. By combining the two capabilities of reliable quantification and targeted rewards, we believe we can provide powerful support for climate change programs that aim to realize the value of forests as a part of the global economy. For instance, the REDD+ program, under development by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aims to incentivize developing countries to reduce emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation, thus conserving and enhancing forest carbon sticks. We will build a public performance-based payment system using two blockchain technologies. The first is an *oracle*, a trustworthy source of data for blockchain applications, it obtains and analyzes satellite data to relay trustworthy statistics on forest carbon. The second key component is a *smart contract*, a blockchain application that consumes data from the oracle and sends cryptocurrency rewards to forest stewards. Our system will also automatically identify the legitimate stakeholders / stewards of forested land by combining local land registry records, geolocation via smartphones, and fraud / anomaly detection.

     name: 'Libra'
     challenges: [*scaling, *confidentiality]
     description: We present Libra, the first zero-knowledge proof system that has both optimal prover time and succinct proof size/verification time. In particular, if C is the size of the circuit being proved (i) the prover time is O(C) irrespective of the circuit type; (ii) the proof size and verification time are both O(d log C) for d-depth log-space uniform circuits (such as RAM programs). In addition Libra features an one-time trusted setup that depends only on the size of the input to the circuit and not the circuit logic. Underlying Libra is a new linear-time algorithm for the prover of the interactive proof protocol by Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum (also known as GKR protocol), as well as an efficient approach to turn the GKR protocol to zero-knowledge using small masking polynomials. Not only does Libra have excellent asymptotics, but it is also efficient in practice. For example, our implementation shows that it takes 200 seconds to generate a proof for constructing a SHA2-based Merkle tree root on 256 leaves, outperforming all existing zero-knowledge proof systems. Proof size and verification time of Libra are also competitive. For more see <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/317.pdf">our paper</a>.

     challenges: [*correctness, *migration]
     description: The Smart Contract Information Flow (SCIF) project aims to develop a usable and expressive programming language for smart contracts that enforces strong security guarantees for every program. It incorporates information flow control into its type system to maintain the integrity of a contract's data and control flow, ensuring contacts cannot perform dangerous operations as a result of untrustworthy inputs. SCIF uses these techniques to provably eliminate large classes of vulnerabilities, including the bugs that allowed attackers to extract and freeze tens of millions of dollars in the two Parity Wallet incidents, and reentrancy vulnerabilities that have plagued The DAO and Uniswap. Additionally, it mixes static analysis and dynamic checks to provide compositional security---ensuring that the security of multiple independent components composes to provide security for an entire application---even in the presence of unknown or legacy code that does not provide the same guarantees.

    name: 'Solidus: Confidential Financial Transaction Settlement on a Distributed Ledgers'
    challenges: [*scaling, *confidentiality]
    description: Solidus is a cryptocurrency (&quot;blockchain&quot;) that can be run by a confederation or consortium of trustworthy entities-- -banks, governments, auditors, etc. While it retains some of the benefits of decentralization, Solidus offers higher performance and tighter governance and control than existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Many successful peer-to- peer technologies have historically been eclipsed or supplanted by centralized or commercial systems (e.g., in the online music industry). Solidus addresses the possibility and desire by many financial institutions that cryptocurrencies and contracts will follow a similar path. For more info, please see the Solidus presentation at our <a href="http://www.initc3.org/events/2016-05-17-IC3-Retreat-2016.html">2016 IC3 Retreat (https://tinyurl.com/ic3retreat)</a> in NYC.

    name: 'Bitcoin-NG: A Next-generation Blockchain Protocol'
    challenges: [*scaling]
    description: Bitcoin-NG is a new protocol pioneered by IC3. It addresses the scalability bottleneck of Bitcoin by enabling the Bitcoin network to achieve the highest throughput allowed by the network conditions. Paradoxically, not only does it improve transaction throughput, it also reduces transaction latencies -- it is possible to get an initial transaction confirmation in seconds rather than in minutes. And it does so without changing Bitcoin’s open architecture and trust model. Our blockchain test bed Miniature World simulated Bitcoin-NG at 15% the size of the operational Bitcoin system, where we showed that Bitcoin–NG is only limited by the network. For more info, please see our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02037">paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02037)</a>.

    name: "Fruitchain: A new Approach for Incentive Compatible Blockchains"
    challenges: [*scaling]
    description: Most of today's blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are not "incentive compatible", meaning they are quite vulnerable to strategic gaming by dishonest adversaries. For example, IC3 has proven that the Bitcoin blockchain can be compromised by miners or mining pools with much less than 50% of the mining hash power. Fruitchain is an innovative blockchain methodology that discourages dishonest gaming, by making it extremely unprofitable for an adversary with less than 50% of the hash power, achieving an epsilon-equilibrium or near-Nash equilibrium. For more info, please see the Fruitchain presentation by IC3 co-director Professor Elaine Shi at our <a href="http://www.initc3.org/events/2016-05-17-IC3-Retreat-2016.html">2016 IC3 Retreat (https://tinyurl.com/ic3retreat)</a> in NYC.

    name: "FLAC: A Calculus for Flow-Limited Authorization"
    challenges: [*correctness]
    description: Real-world applications routinely make authorization decisions based on dynamic computation. Integrity of the system might be compromised if attackers can improperly influence the authorizing computation. Confidentiality can also be compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC) is both a simple, expressive model for reasoning about dynamic authorization and also a language for securely implementing various authorization mechanisms. FLAC provides strong end-to- end information security guarantees even for programs that incorporate and implement rich dynamic authorization mechanisms. For more info, please see the presentation by Professor Andrew Myers “Verifying Information Security of Code in Dynamic Systems” at our <a href="http://www.initc3.org/events/2016-05-17-IC3-Retreat-2016.html">2016 IC3 Retreat (https://tinyurl.com/ic3retreat)</a> in NYC.

    name: "Theoretical Foundations for Secure Decentralized Systems"
    challenges: [*correctness]
    description: This work explores the theoretical basis for the security and stability of open decentralized systems. The benefits of decentralization include resistance to many kinds of attacks, diversity, and diffusion of power. The novelty and inspiring success of Bitcoin has provided new evidence that secure decentralized systems are more feasible than once thought. On the other hand, even Bitcoin risks becoming centralized if thrown off-balance, e.g. due to mining pools, ASIC farms, or political schisms. Furthermore, IC3 and collaborators just released a research paper that analyzed The Digital Autonomous Organization (DAO) and its voting mechanism. This paper identifies problems with The DAO&#39;s mechanism design that incentivize investors to behave strategically; that is, at odds with truthful voting on their preferences. We then outline potential attacks against The DAO made possible by these behaviors.

     name: "Town Crier: Authenticated Data Feeds for Smart Contracts"
     challenges: [*confidentiality, *adf, *migration]
     description: In order to reason about the real world, smart contracts in cryptocurrency systems will rely on informational input from what we call authenticated data feeds (ADFs); such information can include stock prices, meteorological reports, news, and other current events. It is therefore important that an ADF be trustworthy, in the sense of providing security against manipulation by an attacker attempting to influence the outcome of a contract. By utilizing trusted hardware to provide reliable, digitally signed attestations on data to client contracts, the Town Crier system can serve as a trustworthy ADF under minimal trust assumptions about its operator.

     name: "EtherScrape: A Complementary Block Explorer for the Ethereum Blockchain"
     challenges: [*adf]
     description: Smart Contracts in Ethereum are written in a high-level programming language (typically Serpent or Solidity) and then compiled down to bytecode for the Ethereum virtual machine. This compilation step removes a lot of the useful information found in the high level source code, such as comments, names of variables, etc. If you can identify the high-level source code for a contract, you have a better chance of figuring out what it does. EtherScrape uses fingerprinting to match each smart contract on the blockchain (that is, the compiled bytecode) to the high-level source code that created it.

     name: "Gyges: Crime in Decentralized Smart Contracts "
     challenges: [*compliance]
     description: Two of the most widely desired goals for &quot;Bitcoin 2.0&quot; are privacy and more expressive smart contracts. Many uses of cryptocurrency have a clear and legitimate need for privacy (e.g., financial service companies are expected to protect the privacy of their clients&#39; transactions). General purpose smart contract programming frameworks make it easy to tinker, prototype, and search for the next &quot;killer application&quot; for cryptocurrencies. These two directions seem to be at odds with each other; however, through the use of sophisticated cryptography (like zero knowledge proofs and multi-party computation), we explore how to achieve both goals at once. For further details, please see our paper at <a href="http://www.initc3.org/files/Gyges.pdf">http://www.initc3.org/files/Gyges.pdf</a>.
