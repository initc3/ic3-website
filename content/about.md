# About Our Initiative

<img src="images/styling/jacobs.jpg" class="ui large right floated image"/>

IC3 is an initiative of faculty members at Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Cornell Tech, EPFL, ETH Zurich, UC Berkeley, University College London, UIUC and the Technion. It's based at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech in NYC.

## Background and Objectives

Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts are emerging into a rich spectrum of new financial instruments and business
tools, and blending finance with computer science in unprecedented ways. IC3 is collaborating with domain
experts in finance and banking, entrepreneurs, regulators, and open source software communities to move these
blockchain-based solutions from today’s white boards and proof-of-concepts to tomorrow’s fast and reliable
financial systems of execution and record.

## Skill Sets and Deliverables

IC3 uniquely meets the blockchain community&#39;s urgent need for world-class expertise in computer science that
    spans cryptography, distributed systems, programming languages, game theory, and system security techniques. IC3
    applies this depth of expertise to deliver value on the two nested levels of science and code:

- *Blockchain Science*: Bringing the science of blockchains to the forefront of blockchain technology
        development.
        Currently most cryptocurrencies and contracts rely on heuristic designs without a formal basis upon which
        strong assurance of security properties might be achieved. Establishing a rigorous scientific foundation for
        efficient, scalable, high assurance blockchain-based solutions is a critical need that IC3 is highly
        qualified to satisfy.

- *Blockchain Code*: Delivering blockchain innovation in code, underpinned by solid scientific
        foundations.
        We collaborate on the development and verification of multiple Open Source blockchain tools and solutions to
        meet the expectations of the financial industry for breakthroughs in cost, security, privacy and
        performance. Our blockchain test bed Miniature World simulates real world scenarios at scale; such as
        experiments at 15% the size of the operational Bitcoin system, where we compared Bitcoin with Bitcoin–NG, a
        new high performance blockchain protocol pioneered by IC3.

## Funding

We invite partners in industry, law and commerce to sponsor and collaborate with us in our mission to deliver powerful,
    principled, and practical innovations. Please see our <a href="http://www.initc3.org/partners.html">Partners page</a>
    for how to get involved.

## Outcomes

Expected outcomes of our work include new cryptocurrency and smart contract solutions that are easy to program
    and formally verifiable, with provable security properties that meet industry’s expectations for efficiency and
    reliability. These include financially enforceable cryptographic protocols whose security properties are backed
    by enforceable payments in case of a breach, as well as high-assurance, high performance systems for storing and
    handling high-value cryptocurrencies and confidential transactions. Please see our <a
        href="http://www.initc3.org/projects.html">Projects page</a> for more info. All IC3 projects funded by our industry partners are open source.
        
## Governance

IC3 distributes funds internally primarily according to a competitive grant process, conducted at least twice yearly. 
    We have committed to the following priorities: fostering collaboration between IC3 researchers and partners, 
    technology transfer for IC3 research, career support for junior faculty, promoting participation of women and 
    minorities in the blockchain technology area, and encouraging interdisciplinary and cross-campus collaboration 
    among IC3 faculty. IC3 Co-Directors meet monthly.
    
IC3 has created for program chairs and other interested colleagues the following statement on conflicts of interest for 
    publication submissions: <a
