 authors: Bryan Ford and Rainer Böhme
 summary: If you think you have designed a permissionless decentralized system that is cleverly secured based on rationality assumptions, you haven't. This blog post, based partly on ideas from Rainer Böhme's talk at the recent BDLT Summer School in Vienna, sketches an argument that rationality assumptions are self-defeating in open permissionless systems with weak identities.

 authors: Yujin Kwon, Jian Liu, Minjeong Kim, Dawn Song, and Yongdae Kim
 summary: Decentralization is an essential factor the should be inherently considered in the design of blockchain systems. Even though people design systems for good decentralization, in practice, we often observe that blockchain systems are highly centralized. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as representative examples, are already well known to be highly centralized in terms of network and mining. In fact, poor decentralization appears not only in PoW-based coins but also in coins adopting other mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS).

 title: "Just Enough Security for Cryptocurrencies"
 authors: Itay Tsabary, Alexander Spiegelman, and Ittay Eyal
 summary: Proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms secure about 80% of the $250B cryptocurrency market. PoW requires system participants to expend computational resources, and protects the system from attackers who cannot expend resources at an equivalent rate. These systems operate in the permissionless setting and compensate their users with cryptocurrency, having a monetary value. As cryptocurrency prices sore so do the invested resources, and Bitcoin expenditures alone are 0.24% of the global electricity consumption. Arguably, this is superfluous, and lowering the ecological footprint justifies settling for a lower attack threshold.

 authors: Ittay Eyal
 summary: Proof of Work (PoW) Blockchains implement a form of State Machine Replication (SMR). Unlike classical SMR protocols, they are open, i.e., anyone can join the system, and the system incentivizes participants, called miners, to follow the protocol. Therefore, unlike classical SMR protocols, reasoning about blockchain security relies not only on bounding the number of malicious participants. One should crucially ask whether miners are indeed incentivized to follow the prescribed protocol. This is the topic of this post.

 summary: Many central banks are considering, and some are even piloting, central bank digital currency. This column provides an overview of important considerations for central bank digital currency design. While central banks already provide wholesale digital currency to financial institutions, a retail central bank digital currency would expand access to more users and provide opportunities for innovative central banking. The design must balance these benefits with the potential risks created by retail central bank currency deployment.

 title: "Making Decentralized Identity Possible with CanDID"
 authors: Deepak Maram and Harjasleen Malvai
 summary: Decentralized identity systems allow users to gather and amnage their own credentials under the banner of self-created decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The key focus of DIDs is on shifting the control of a credential into users' hands. Existing decentralized identity proposals, however, suffer from several problems. First and foremost, how do you bootstrap an ecosystem of credential issuers? It is unlikely that most existing legacy providers suddenly switch and issue such credentials. Second, like with cryptocurrencies, DID systems burden users with managing their own keys creating a significant risk of key loss. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users. We address these problems by introducing CanDID in our new paper.

 summary: Payment channels are one of the fundamental approaches for scaling cryptocurrency networks. In the academic cryptography literature on payment channels, it has been effective to use universal composability (UC) framework as a way of rigorously modeling and giving security definitions. However, there's been a big gap between the UC model and the actual software implementations of payment channels that have been designed and maintained by cryptocurrency developers, not getting as much benefit from the UC as we could. SaUCy is a project that aims to bridge the world of cryptocurrency developers with the UC framework.

 title: "Order-Fair Consensus: Reducing MEV at the Consensus Layer"
 authors: Mahimna Kelkar
 summary: In current blockchain consensus protocols, a single miner or validator unilaterally controls the inclusion and ordering of transactions in a block. This form of temporary centralization is entirely at odds with the goals of decentralization. It also poses an acute problem for decentralized finance (DeFi). Arbitrageurs today are engaged in rampant collusion with miners to reorder transactions and extract profit at the expense of ordinary DeFi users. In the process of doing so, arbitrageurs are also participating in systemic bribery and even threatening the consensus stability of blockchains. So far in 2021, the impact of opportunistic transaction recording - often called MEV or miner/maximum extractable value - has exceeded $550 million by one conservative estimate.

 title: "Your Digital Assets Can Be Safer"
 authors: Ittay Eyal
 summary: Securing digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs is a tricky business, as demonstrated by numerous losses and heists. The challenge of storing digital assets applies equally to individuals and to larger actors - from companies to cryptocurrency exchanges to the largest financial services corporates. Digital assets are secured (almost exclusively) with cryptographic signing keys. But from the early days of Bitcoin it was clear that our mechanisms, which worked perfectly well in the olden days, are inadequate. Our mobile devices are (maybe) secure enough for our emails, but not for cash. Plastic cards work for authorizing transactions if we can cancel them with a phone call, but that's not the case with digital cash that has no 'undo'. Indeed, for securing digital assets it is not uncommon to use multiple keys.

 summary: Prominent smart contracts, e.g., roll-ups, critically rely on timely confirmations of their transactions. Sadly, that's not how blockchain works, as confirmation times depend on transactions fees, where the required fee is determined by the volatile fee market. We present LedgerHedger, the first smart contract that facilitates a reservation for a future transaction confirmation. LedgerHedger is secure, incentive-compatible, and has low overhead for practical future-transaction parameters.

The Bitcoin community has mentioned similar types of attacks in 2010. This attack remains a vulnerability of all operational blockchains we are aware of. For Bitcoin's blockchain algorithm (under reasonable network assumptions), a coalition controlling over 1/4 of the mining power can improve its revenue using this attack.

 authors: Weizhao Tang, Lucianna Kiffer, Giulia Fanti and Ari Juels
 summary: In traditional financial systems, time equals money and network latency - i.e., the time for messages to travel in a network - has an outsized impact. Recently, network latency has become critical in blockchain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks as well. Among other impacts, low-latency connections in P2P networks can advantage arbitrageurs by giving them the ability to exploit the trades of other users for financial gain. In this blog post, we summarize a recent paper of ours that explores P2P network latency. We present Peri, a practical strategy that selects peers with low latencies from a local view of the P2P network. we demonstrate how startegic agents, i.e., self-interested P2P network actors, can use Peri to manipulate network latency to their advantage.

 authors: Youer Pu, Lorenzo Alvisi and Ittay Eyal
 summary: The Nakamoto consensus protocol works in a permissionless model, where nodes can join and leave without notice. However, it guarantees agreement only probabilistically. Is this weaker guarantee a necessary concession to the severe demands of supporting a permissionless model? We show that, at least in a benign failure model, it is not. We present Sandglass, the first permissionless consensus algorithm that guarantees deterministic agreement and termination with probability 1 under general omission failures. Like Nakamoto, Sandglass adopts a hybrid synchronous communication model, where, at all times, a majority of nodes (though their number is unknown) are correct and synchronously connected, and allows nodes to join and leave at any time.

Physical works of art — oil paintings, for instance — look very different in person than in posters or digital images. I've spent twenty minutes staring at <a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.1236.html">this Vermeer</a> in person. I can assure you that the sacred hush magically rendered by the artist in the original painting is all but obliterated in reproduction. There’s another facet to appreciation of art, though, one that’s not just about brushstrokes or esthetic nuance. Why, after all, do people flock to see the Mona Lisa when they can barely make it out through the ten-foot thick protective barrier of tourists?

We argue that the most important only exit from a future where power dynamics in cryptocurrency become centralized and predatory is through geographic decentralization. We then explore the relationship between geographic decentralization and privacy, which in our opinion will be a dominant economic phenomenon in the next decade of MEV evolution.

 summary: TLDR - The Sting Framework (SF) is a new idea for bolstering the security of systems at risk of information leakage. SF addresses the case where a corrupt service (called a Subversion Service) arises that enables adversaries to exploit such leakage. SF presumes a player, called an informer, that wishes to alert the community to the presence of the corrupt service — either as a public service or to claim a bounty. SF enables the informer to generate a publicly verifiable proof that the corrupt service exists.

 summary: Enhancing smart contract privacy is a critical stride towards the development of more useful blockchain applications. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) or secure enclaves are being used in multiple networks (<a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>, <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Network</a>, <a href="https://obscu.ro/">Obscuro</a>, etc) to enable privacy without significantly increasing computational costs. However, the utilization of TEEs also brings forth challenges, specifically in designing secure network architectures that fully capitalize on the strengths of TEEs while mitigating potential risks.

 title: "F3B: A practical per-transaction front-running mitigation solution for blockchain"
 authors: Haoqian Zhang
 summary: The name “front-running” came from when a broker needs to deliver the clients’ orders to the trading desk physically. The term vividly describes how it works - an attacker who knows a large order could run ahead to execute a trade before the client’s order goes through. What is the incentive for someone to do that? Here is an example that explains why. Suppose a broker receives a large order from a client, say, buy 500,000 shares of a company’s stock. The order is big enough to drive up the share’s price. Knowing this information, an attacker can place his small order, say 10,000 shares of the same stock, before the large order. The attacker can sell his shares at a higher price when the price goes up after the large order went through. The formal definition of front-running is a practice of benefiting from the advanced knowledge of pending transactions. Although benefiting some entities involved, this practice puts others at a significant financial disadvantage, making this behavior illegal in traditional markets with established securities regulations.

 summary: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, promise to revolutionize the ways that communities collaborate. The ‘D’ in DAO — the decentralization — is the critical ingredient. But the way most people in the Web3 community reason about DAO decentralization today is flawed. It fails to point the way toward sound DAO governance. Today, people commonly view decentralization in DAOs — and other Web3 projects — entirely in terms of how tokens are distributed among addresses. The <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/gender-statistics/series/SI.POV.GINI#:~:text=Gini">Gini coefficient</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01176">similar measures</a> of wealth inequality — such as entropy of token holdings — are popular metrics for this purpose. A high Gini coefficient over addresses in a DAO is “bad” - it means high concentration — dominant control by whales and other large holders. A low Gini coefficient, on the other hand, is “good,” indicating even distribution of tokens. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03530">Our new research</a> shows that there are gaping blind spots in this view of DAO decentralization. Happily, we also show that it’s possible to do better.

 title: "DAOs Must Confront Dark DAOs — Or Fall Under Their Shadow"
 authors: James Austgen, Andrés Fábrega, Sarah Allen, Kushal Babel, Mahimna Kelkar, and Ari Juels
 summary: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are increasingly popular, and already managing many <a href="https://deepdao.io/organizations">billions of dollars</a> in treasuries. Their decentralized governance is a transformative new way of organizing communities. But as they grow, DAOs will face a new and potent threat to their decentralization - Dark DAOs. A Dark DAO is a private smart contract that targets a legitimate DAO, attacking its voting integrity by enabling vote-buying among its users. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/20/the-dark-dao-threat-vote-vulnerability-could-undermine-crypto-elections/">First considered</a> in 2018, Dark DAOs haven’t yet appeared in the wild — but only because DAOs are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12125">not very decentralized</a> today. As DAOs continue on a path to higher decentralization, Dark DAOs will inevitably surface. Vote-buying may be illegal in political elections, but in DAOs it’s probably legal. It’s <a href="https://hbr.org/2005/06/shareholder-votes-for-sale">legal</a> in shareholder voting and there’s even a <a href="https://www.svegroup.com/">marketplace</a> to facilitate it. Vote-buying in DAOs would follow the trend in Web3 of monetizing everything from <a href="https://www.friend.tech/">people’s friends</a> to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-mev-aka-maximal-extractable-value/">maximal-extractable value (MEV)</a>.
