 summary: ZeroWallet is a new protocol that uses zero knowledge proofs to secure private keys with low-entropy passwords. It provides the convenience of brain wallets with a security guarantee comparable to third party multi-sig setups.

 authors: Bryan Ford and Rainer Böhme
 summary: If you think you have designed a permissionless decentralized system that is cleverly secured based on rationality assumptions, you haven't. This blog post, based partly on ideas from Rainer Böhme's talk at the recent BDLT Summer School in Vienna, sketches an argument that rationality assumptions are self-defeating in open permissionless systems with weak identities.

 authors: Yujin Kwon, Jian Liu, Minjeong Kim, Dawn Song, and Yongdae Kim
 summary: Decentralization is an essential factor the should be inherently considered in the design of blockchain systems. Even though people design systems for good decentralization, in practice, we often observe that blockchain systems are highly centralized. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as representative examples, are already well known to be highly centralized in terms of network and mining. In fact, poor decentralization appears not only in PoW-based coins but also in coins adopting other mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS).

 title: "Just Enough Security for Cryptocurrencies"
 authors: Itay Tsabary, Alexander Spiegelman, and Ittay Eyal
 summary: Proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms secure about 80% of the $250B cryptocurrency market. PoW requires system participants to expend computational resources, and protects the system from attackers who cannot expend resources at an equivalent rate. These systems operate in the permissionless setting and compensate their users with cryptocurrency, having a monetary value. As cryptocurrency prices sore so do the invested resources, and Bitcoin expenditures alone are 0.24% of the global electricity consumption. Arguably, this is superfluous, and lowering the ecological footprint justifies settling for a lower attack threshold.

 authors: Michael Mirkin, Yan Ji, Jonathan Pang, Ariah Klages-Mundt, Ittay Eyal, and Ari Juels
 summary: We have discovered a denial-of-service attack on Bitcoin-like blockchains that is much cheaper than previously described attacks. Such blockchains rely on incentives to provide security. We show how an attacker can disrupt those incentives to cause rational miners to stop mining.

 title: "Streamlet: A Simple Textbook Blockchain Protocol"
 authors: Benjamin Chan and Elaine Shi
 summary: In this post, we described an extraordinarily simple blockchain protocol called Streamlet. Consensus is a complex problem and has been studied since the 1980s. More recently, blockchain research has spawned many new works aiming for performance and ease-of-implementation. However, simple, understandable protocols remain elusive, and that's where Streamlet comes in.

 summary: In this paper, we enumerate the fundamental technical design challenges facing CBDC designers, with a particular focus on performance, privacy, and security. Through a survey of relevant academic and industry research and deployed systems, we discuss the state of the art in technologies that can address the challenges involved in successful CBDC deployment. We also present a vision of the rich range of functionalities and use cases that a well-designed CBDC platform could ultimately offer users.

 summary: Many central banks are considering, and some are even piloting, central bank digital currency. This column provides an overview of important considerations for central bank digital currency design. While central banks already provide wholesale digital currency to financial institutions, a retail central bank digital currency would expand access to more users and provide opportunities for innovative central banking. The design must balance these benefits with the potential risks created by retail central bank currency deployment.

 summary: Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains. We propose a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction to reinforce the Ethereum ideals.

 summary: We have focused on building a non-custodial relayer, Infura Transaction Service (ITX), that takes a pre-signed message (e.g. meta-transaction), packs it into an Ethereum transaction and then gradually bumps the fee until it is mined in the blockchain.

 title: "Making Decentralized Identity Possible with CanDID"
 authors: Deepak Maram and Harjasleen Malvai
 summary: Decentralized identity systems allow users to gather and amnage their own credentials under the banner of self-created decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The key focus of DIDs is on shifting the control of a credential into users' hands. Existing decentralized identity proposals, however, suffer from several problems. First and foremost, how do you bootstrap an ecosystem of credential issuers? It is unlikely that most existing legacy providers suddenly switch and issue such credentials. Second, like with cryptocurrencies, DID systems burden users with managing their own keys creating a significant risk of key loss. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users. We address these problems by introducing CanDID in our new paper.

 title: "Using Universal Composability To Implement Off-Chain Payment Channels"
 authors: Jun-You Liu, Surya Bakshi, Shreyas Gandlur, Ankush Das, and Andrew Miller
 summary: Payment channels are one of the fundamental approaches for scaling cryptocurrency networks. In the academic cryptography literature on payment channels, it has been effective to use universal composability (UC) framework as a way of rigorously modeling and giving security definitions. However, there's been a big gap between the UC model and the actual software implementations of payment channels that have been designed and maintained by cryptocurrency developers, not getting as much benefit from the UC as we could. SaUCy is a project that aims to bridge the world of cryptocurrency developers with the UC framework.

 title: "Order-Fair Consensus: Reducing MEV at the Consensus Layer"
 authors: Mahimna Kelkar
 summary: In current blockchain consensus protocols, a single miner or validator unilaterally controls the inclusion and ordering of transactions in a block. This form of temporary centralization is entirely at odds with the goals of decentralization. It also poses an acute problem for decentralized finance (DeFi). Arbitrageurs today are engaged in rampant collusion with miners to reorder transactions and extract profit at the expense of ordinary DeFi users. In the process of doing so, arbitrageurs are also participating in systemic bribery and even threatening the consensus stability of blockchains. So far in 2021, the impact of opportunistic transaction recording - often called MEV or miner/maximum extractable value - has exceeded $550 million by one conservative estimate.
