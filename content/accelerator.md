Taking our research from proofs-of-concept to the real world

The goal of the IC3 accelerator is to acknowledge the research being done by IC3 faculty and students, and find ways to turn these ideas into startups that have far-reaching impacts 

IC3 is home to many companies and organizations that have played a key role in shaping the blockchain industry. Our alumni have gone on to build successful companies, including Chainlink Labs, Ava Labs, Offchain Labs, Flashbots, Gyroscope, Oasis Labs, and others.   

We care deeply about blockchain R&D and want to continue to advance the work being done by our students. This marks the first year of the IC3 accelerator in partnership with Panteraâ€™s Catalyze program. The accelerator will be managed by Cornell University students and IC3 members
