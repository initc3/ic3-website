The <strong>IC3-Cornell Blockchain Accelerator</strong> is an initiative designed to transform bold ideas into real-world applications. In a space that moves quickly, we aim to bring “proof of research” and rigorous discipline to the next wave of companies in the space.

At least one member with a technical background and an affiliation to IC3 or Cornell is required to be eligible and participate. 

## A Legacy of Innovation & Research

IC3 and Cornell have a proud history of fostering some of the blockchain industry's most influential projects. Alumni and research from our ecosystem have led to the creation of companies like <strong>Chainlink Labs, Ava Labs, Offchain Labs, Flashbots, Gyroscope, Oasis Labs</strong>, and many others.

Our commitment to advancing blockchain R&D is stronger than ever. This inaugural year of the <strong>IC3-Cornell Blockchain Accelerator</strong> will be led by a dedicated team of IC3 members, Cornell students, and alumni, continuing our tradition of innovation and excellence. We are grateful for <a href="https://sba.sites.stanford.edu/">Stanford Blockchain Accelerator’s</a> support in helping us launch this initiative.
