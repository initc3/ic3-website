## Boot Camp PROJECTS

**Build Ethereum Applications Using the Town Crier (TC) Data-feed System**: Use
Town Crier to construct an end-to-end, confidentiality-preserving flight
insurance system and a microfinance platform.

**Ethereum Vaults**: Construct an operational vault ecosystem (including client
software and online services) to protect clients against key theft, bringing to
Ethereum users unparalleled security.

**Add Ethereum Support for Verifying Zero-Knowledge Proofs (SNARKs):**
Zero-knowledge SNARK proofs are critical technology for many privacy-preserving
smart contract applications. The goal of this project is to add support (e.g.,
new Ethereum opcodes) to make it feasible to verify SNARK proofs from within a
smart contract.

__Build a Fair Multi-player Lottery Game with Minimal Amount of
Collateral:__ The Oakland ‘14 Best Paper involved a fair Bitcoin lottery for N
players. However, this required O(N\^2) collateral. In Ethereum, this is
possible with only O(N) collateral.

__Machine Learning As-a-Service (MLAAS) using Smart Contracts (TensorFlow +
Ethereum):__ Build a training / classification / prediction service with
Ethereum and TensorFlow (other ML frameworks may be explored, time permitting)
that accepts payments using a smart contract.

## IC3-Ethereum Crypto Workshop

The week of intense development culminated in the IC3-Ethereum Crypto Workshop
on July 28.
