We reserved a block of rooms at the Terrace Hotel, which will serve as both the lodging and session venue for the retreat. Oana Gherman will book rooms for anyone who wishes to be part of the hotel block. If you choose to be included, please refrain from booking a separate room, as this would result in having two reservations. 

For any inquiries related to accommodations, please reach out to Oana at <a href="mailto:og64@cornell.edu">oana.gherman@cornell.edu</a>.

***Sharing Rooms:*** Students are expected to share accommodations with other students attending the retreat. If you need assistance finding other students who are attending, please let us know.


## Important Reminders

***IC3 Partners:*** Each partner company is permitted to send up to *5 employees* to attend the Winter Retreat. Unfortunately, we can’t accommodate any more than that due to capacity limitations.

***Swiss Visa Applicants:*** For participants who require visas to enter Switzerland, we encourage you to initiate the visa application process immediately. Securing a visa for a first-time visitor involves several steps, including scheduling an appointment at your Swiss consulate or embassy. Should you require an invitation letter for your visa application, please contact <a href="mailto:og64@cornell.edu">Oana</a> directly.


Be on the lookout for additional updates in the coming weeks. We hope to see you in Switzerland!
