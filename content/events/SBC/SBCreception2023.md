Overall, the reception was a celebration of the blockchain community's vibrancy and provided opportunities for new and continued connections between researchers working in academic and industry, toward IC3’s goal of fostering the collaborations that move blockchain-based solutions from today’s white boards and proof-of-concepts to tomorrow’s fast and reliable financial systems of execution and record.

**Thanks again to all who joined us and we hope to see you soon at future IC3 events!**
