The event featured an exciting schedule, including talks by IC3 faculty, students, partners, and invited guests. Talks were given via Zoom and focused around four themes:

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

- Blockchain for Financial Systems

- Blockchain for Social Good

- Smart Contract Assurance

After each session of talks, speakers and attendees met to discuss their work in small groups on Gather.Town to facilitate the cross-campus and industry-academia collaborations for which IC3 is known.

The retreat also featured a panel on "The Broken Fee Market" led by Phil Daian, a town hall focused on the next big thing in blockchain led by Patrick McCorry, and ample networking opportunities!
