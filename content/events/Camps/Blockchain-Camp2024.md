### PROGRAM

We will offer two overlapping tracks: a coding track and a presentation track.

<strong>Option 1 (Coding):</strong> The coding track includes all presentations, social activities, and participation in a weeklong coding project on a 5-10 person team. In the coding track, you can expect to engage with leaders in the blockchain community - faculty, architects, developers, students.

Both tracks require pre-registration. Please use the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8PlAwTPSK3a1vfe89jR2SFvoMkpoIZW0ZnwCTJDotsK1Wcg/viewform">registration form</a></strong>. Those who register will receive additional details by email before the event.
