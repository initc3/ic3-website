## COMMENTS from PARTICIPANTS

"The Boot Camp was excellent! It was a unique and awesome experience to spend the week working alongside, and learning from, renowned blockchain researchers and so many experts from the Ethereum community." – Brian Schroeder, Blockchain Engineer, J.P. Morgan


"Writing secure smart contracts in Solidity, finding ERC20 token exploits, and learning new professional security auditing techniques were all very insightful activities. I wish we had extra time in the day to work on more than one project! The Boot Camp was great!" – Mark Barrasso, Software Engineer, Cisco
