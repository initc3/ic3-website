summary: Prof. Ari Juels, IC3 co-Director, will describe Town Crier (TC), an authenticated data feed system built using Intel’s new SGX trusted hardware features. TC acts as a trustworthy proxy between existing (HTTPS-enabled) servers and smart contracts without any need for users to trust the system’s operators. Unlike basic oracles, TC also supports private queries, which offer the critical property of confidentiality for data requests, and custom queries, which make secure use of users’ credentials. Applications include insurance contracts that protect consumer privacy, systems to trade online resources such as games for cryptocurrency, and much more.
