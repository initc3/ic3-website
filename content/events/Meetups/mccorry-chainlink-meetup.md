summary: Cryptocurrencies do not scale. In this technical deep-dive, we provide an overview of an alternative scaling approach, off-chain protocols, that lets parties transact locally amongst themselves instead of the global network. Off-chain is remarkable as in the best case it lets parties bypass all network fees and blockchain latency, and in the worst-case, the parent blockchainsafeguards the funds of all honest parties. We'll cover the two leading approaches, channel-based networks (lightning et al) and commit-chains (plasma & rollup et al) alongside the new the always online assumption and how the community is trying to alleviate it. If we, as a community, can pull off the implementation of off-chain protocols, it will hopefully unleash a truly permissionless, global and internet-scale financial system.

**Speakers**

Sergey in CEO of Chainlink, the leading blockchain middleware company, used by enterprises (SWIFT, Google, Oracle) and smart contract teams (Web3 Foundation, OpenZeppelin, Hedera Hashgraph, Zilliqa, and many others). Working with leading banks, insurance companies, and large technology firms on the creation of "externally connected smart contracts", gives him a unique perspective on what is required to bring smart contracts forward for enterprise adoption.

Dr. Patrick McCorry is the CEO and co-founder of PISA Research. He was an Assistant Professor at King's College London in Cryptocurrencies and Security Engineering. As well, he was a researcher at University College London, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Newcastle University. Many moons ago, he also worked at IBM UK on the CICS Portfolio which is used by most banks in the world. His focus is cryptocureencies, smart contracts, applied cryptography, and decentralized systems. Patrick is the UK's first PhD graduate in Cryptocurrencies and his work has recently appeared at Devcon3'4'5, Scaling Bitcoin 17'19', Breaking Bitcoin 17, CESC 17, BPASE 19, and SBC19 alongside numerous academic venues. 

**PISA Research**

At PISA Research, our goal is to build the missing components for an off-chain, open-source, global and permissionless financial system. Over the past few years, we have helped set the foundation for off-chain, is adopted by billions of users.

**Chainlink**

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments. Chainlink is consistently selected as one of the top blockchain technologies by leading independent research firms such as Gartner. It is well known for providing highly secure and reliable oracles to both large enterprises (SWIFT, Google, Oracle) and leading smart contract development teams.
