Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have created an exciting new area of research at the intersection of computer science, art, law, and economics. The event featured the unveiling of an artist-made glass projection screen showcasing a gallery of NFTs that represent the latest NFT research from IC3. It also featured talks highlighting advances in NFT technology from faculty and students across a range of disciplines.
