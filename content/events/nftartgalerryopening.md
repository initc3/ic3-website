**About this event**
                                                                                                                                                    
The Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3) invites you to an evening of art, cutting-edge research, and NFTs. Join us for the inaugural NFT art gallery opening at Cornell Tech in New York City. Light refreshments will be served.
                                                                                                                                                    
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have created an exciting new area of research at the intersection of computer science, art, law, and economics. The event will feature the unveiling of an artist-made glass projection screen showcasing a gallery of NFTs that represent the latest NFT research from IC3. It will also feature talks highlighting advances in NFT technology from faculty and students across a range of disciplines.
