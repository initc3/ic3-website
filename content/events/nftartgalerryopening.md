**About the Event:**

The Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3) hosted an inaugural NFT art gallery opening at Cornell Tech in New York City.
                                                                                                                                                    
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have created an exciting new area of research at the intersection of computer science, art, law, and economics. The event featured the unveiling of an artist-made glass projection screen showcasing a gallery of NFTs that represent the latest NFT research from IC3. It also featured talks highlighting advances in NFT technology from faculty and students across a range of disciplines. 
                                                                                                                                                    
Our thanks to Eirik Ulversøy, a.k.a. *Kitten Mittens*, and to Dapper Labs for their generous loan of historically important and rare CryptoKitties for our experiment at the event in the psychology of NFT viewing.
