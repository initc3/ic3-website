IC3 conducted our sixth immersive weeklong coding and learning experience in Cryptocurrencies, Blockchains, and Smart Contracts with world-leading professors, open source architects, developers, and students. This year we met virtually.

**Participants**

Prof. Ari Juels, IC3 co-Director, welcomed camp participants on Sunday, and shared some brief history of the camp and its impact on the community (recording <a href="https://youtu.be/H5_BYGyPe5E">here</a>). The Camp Technical Committee led by Patrick McCorry, with Surya Bakshi and Tyler Kell, gave an overview of the schedule and expectations, as well as introduced the folks proposing projects for the week.

There were eight project teams that self-selected projects on Sunday after considereing the project proposals. The teams coded throughout the week, and made project presentations and demos on Saturday. 

The top projects (a four-way tie) were selected by our panel of judges: Hudson Jameson, Mikerah Quintyne-Collins, and Hasu.



**Winning Projects (Four-Way Tie)**

***Evaluate the Security Properties and Performance Costs of Rollups***

Members: Patrick McCorry (project leader), Abhimanyu Rawat, Amirreza Sarencheh, Austin Liu, Sarisht Wadhwa, and Chris Buckland.

Summary: Commitchains, and in particular rollups, are a promising scability solution for networks like Etherem. Our team set out to evaluate the security and performance of rollups to better understand why they are secure and how well they can scale the network. We investigated four emerging protocols including Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKSync, and Starknet. In the end, it is clear that rollups can reduce gas costs by at least 10x while retaining security guarantees similar (and close to) Ethereum. All rollups are in their infancy and there is still significant work required by each team to achieve their true vision.

 ***Decentralized Computation for Contingent Claim AMMs***
 
 Members: Edward Mehrez (project leader), Patrick Keifer (project leader), Daxi Li, Mehdi Salehi, Colin Finkbeiner, Zhengxun Wu, Benard Kipkoech, Nicholas Chen, Parth Gargava, Dheeraj Chakilam, and Robert Leifke.
 
 
 ***BadgerSwapV3 using Ratel - Putting uniswap on MPC***
 
 Members: Yunqi Li (project leader), Deepak Maram, Mark Jabbour, Sylvain Bellemare, Japjeet Singh, and Ren Kunpeng.
 
 Summary: We upgraded HoneyBadgerSwap (hbswap) from V2 to V3 to support new features proposed by Uniswap V3 such as concentrated liquidity. Hbswap provides extra confidentiality requirements for automatic market maker by leveraging MPC servers maintaining a specialized sidechain. Hbswap is MEV-resistant and protects trading strategies of individual users being exploited. A live demo is presented. Bckend of the demo contains less than 300 lines of code written in MPC sidechain specialized language -  Ratel.

 ***MEV and Fairness Cage Match: Attack/Defend***
 
 Members: Phil Daian (project leader), Mahimna Kelkar (project leader), Krstal Maughan, Gengmo Qi, Mohammad Nourbakhsh, and Bruno Mazorra. 
 
 
 
 **Additional Projects**
 
 
 ***Personal Smart Contract***
 
 Members: Andrew Miller (project leader), Surya Bakshi, Neo Cho, Justin Gaffney, and Arpit Kumar.
 
 Summary: Our demo of Personal Smart Contracts included:
 
   1. A new design for a hybrid paper wallet and business card;
 
   2. An upgradeable contract and use interface designed to be self-hosted and customized using jsfiddle;

   3. An on-chain calendar booking system for scheduling office hours meetings.

***Blockchain Memes***

Members: Tyler Kell (project leader), Surya Bakshi, Yanis Berkani, and Sid.

Summary: We collected data from six social networks and used that to produce graphs showing the relationship between number of memes posted and cryptocurrency price. This project is not over and we intend to push this line of research further.


***NFTs for Authentic Data Ownership & Study Authorship***

Members: Yan Ji (project leader), Sishan Long (project leader), Aahil Awatramani, Yang Wang, Zheng Wang, and Fan Zhang. 

Summary: We implemented a prototype platform allowing researchers to collect authentic data from users and tokenizing data ownership and study authorship. In particular, we modified Town Crier code to handle private credentials and implemented a light-weight browser extension and user-end proxy to make the data collection tool user friendly. We also deployed NFT smart contract for recording data ownership and study authorship.


***Fledger***

Members: Linus Gasser (project leader) and Bolton Bailey.

Summary: During the IC3 hackathon we managed to add a security feature to the Fledger application, as well as implement a simple decentralized chat. Fledger is a decentralized playground based on webrtc communication, so that a web-browser is enough to join the network. Bolton Bailey added a signature verification to the nodes, so when they join the Fledger network they must give a correct signature to avoid impersonatiing other nodes. Linus added a simple chat application where each node can add messages. The decentralized part makes it that the chat messages are not retrieved from a central server, but from the other nodes running in the system. In a future enhancement, Fledger will be incentivizing storage of messages by distributing tokens for stored messages.

**Camp Schedule**

Monday through Friday featured talks open to the public by blockchain leaders from academia, industry, and the open source community. We also had panels and birds-of-a-feather sessions, and open discussions centered around topics like Real World Crypto, ETH 2.0, and MEV solutions.
