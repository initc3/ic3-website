Join us for the 6th Annual IC3 Blockchain Camp! This 7-day experience will be hosted virtually this year. Our Camp technical committee of Surya Bakshi, Tyler Kell and Patrick McCorry is preparing another immersive coding and learning experience. 

In addition to the tech talks, panels and projects, we are planning social activities, games, chat rooms, and birds-of-a-feather discussions.

Topics will include DeFi, cryptography, privacy, layer 2, and more! 

We are offering two overlapping tracks: a coding track and a presentation track.


**Option 1 (Coding):**

The coding track includes all presentations, virtual social activities, and participation in a weeklong coding project on a 5 - 10 person team. This is limited to IC3 sponsors, faculty, staff, students, and alumni. In the coding track, you can expect to engage with leaders in the blockchain community - faculty, architects, developers, students.


**Option 2 (Presentation):**

The presentation track will be open to the public with many of the daily talks and panels the participants in the coding track join.


**Registration**

Both tracks require pre-registration. Please use our <a href="https://forms.gle/GMZMNi1qdcMSQg8x5">registration form</a>. Those who register will receive additional details and access links bby email prior to the event.
