# The Hackathon

Project teams self-selected projects on Sunday after considering the project proposals. The teams coded throughout the week, and made project presentations and demos on Saturday. Six hackathon teams submitted projects this year. Projects were judged by Sarah Azouvi (Protocol Labs), Lorenz Breidenbach (Chainlink), and Soumya Basu (Cornell).

**The Top 3 Projects:**

    <div class="ui bottom attached message">
    <strong>First Place: "Client Security"</strong><br>
    <strong>Team Members</strong>: Roi Bar-Zur (project leader), Ittay Eyal (project leader), Zerui Cheng, Kristian Gaylord, Shutong Qu, Mohammad Rezaei, Nicolas Serrano, and Lulu Zhou<br>
    <strong>Summary</strong>: Blockchain technology empowers users to directly control their digital assets (e.g., cryptocurrency and NFTs). But, with great power comes great responsibility. Users are also responsible for the security of their own assets. As we can learn from many stories of losses and hacks, this is far from trivial. Our <a href="https://crypto-wallet-designer.github.io/crypto-key-calculator/">website</a> lets users design and deploy a smart contract to secure funds using multiple keys. The user chooses a number of keys and inserts information about the keys (how likely is each key to be safe/lost/leaked/stolen). The website outputs a suggested wallet (optimal up to 6 keys) and lets the user deploy it to Ethereum with their own public keys. Then, the contract can be used with our <a href="https://github.com/Crypto-Wallet-Designer/wallet-client-cli/">command line interface</a>. This project is based on the <a href="https://walletdesign.dev/">previous website</a> and the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1522">research paper</a> by Ittay Eyal (presented at Tokenomics 2021).<br>

**Additional Projects:**

***Atomic NFTs***

Members: Phil Daian (project leader), Tyler Kell (project leader), Jessy Huang, James Austgen, Austin Liu, and Sarisht Wadhwa

Summary: Our project explored using a proof of complete knowledge to create an atomic NFT, and NFT that can only ever be held by an address whose owner has demonstrated having unencumbered access to its private key. The idea behind complete knowledge is that it demonstrates that the owner has control to do anything, and thus cannot be bribed or coerced into behaving a certain way, thwarting guaranteed voting bribery systems and preventing an NFT from being fractionalized inside a smart contract.

***Privacy-preserving additions to PBS and MEV-Boost***

Members: Mikerah Quintyne-Collins (project leader), Surya Bakshi (project leader), Chris Buckland, Quintus Kilbourn, Xinyuan Sun, Leland Lee, and Parth Gargava

Summary: We studied solutions to privacy in the MEV-Boost architecture designed for PBS in the next iteration of Ethereum. Solving privacy was a challenging task, instead we explored a few classes of solutions. both cryptographic and incentive protocols as well, and outlined them in an etresear.ch post. We aim to continue this work going forward and mopre closely study the threshold encryption approach, proposed by some, as a solution.

***Addressing Capital Efficiency in Decentralized Spot Markets***

Members: Songwei Chen (project leader), Wayne Chen (project leader), Michael Mirkin, Fan Zhang, Bineet Mishra, Weizhao Tang, Haoqian Zhang, and Marwa Mouallem

***See you all next year!***
