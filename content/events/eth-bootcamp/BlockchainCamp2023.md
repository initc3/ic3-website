Participants stayed at the Graduate Hotel on the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island.

### The Hackathon 
Project teams self-selected projects on Monday after considering the project proposals. The teams coded throughout the week, and made project presentations and demos on Saturday. Six hackathon teams submitted projects this year. Projects were judged by Sarah Allen (IC3), Patrick McCorry (Arbitrum Foundation), and Surya Bakshi (Offchain Labs). The judging criteria were novelty, practicality, user experience, technical difficulty, and maturity of development within the week.

**Top 3 Projects:**

    <strong>First Place: "TEE"</strong><br>
    <strong>Team Members</strong>: Andrew Miller (project leader), Sylvain Bellemare (project leader), Gabriel Arrouye (project leader), Bunmi Akintade, Yunqi Li, James Austgen, Zhengxun Wu, Surya Bakshi, Swei Chen, Amber Seira, and Nerla Jean-Louis<br>
    <strong>Summary</strong>: TEE smart contracts like Secret, Oasis, Phala, Obscuro, are the hot new programming framework. See more details <a href="https://blockchainsplusx.github.io/">here</a>. There’s an obstacle to providing privacy, which is the need to use ORAM or even a linear scan to avoid side channels. Read <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/378">SGXonerated</a>. Basically, Secret Network have not been able to provide strong privacy after the disclosure. Can we fix it? It turns out there’s a surprisingly simple way to use the existing programming models to provide off-chain computation, "Rolls ups for free using TEEs." Basically, we are using the integrity&privacy property of the TEE as a way to skip needing a zk Rollup or dispute period, etc. We will use as a starting point the dockerized development environment from the sgxonerated paper. We could explore using Oasis instead of SN in two concurrent task forces.<br>
    <strong>Resources</strong>: This concept is described <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/tradeoffs-discussion-access-pattern-hiding-spicy-printfs/6884/15?u=amiller">here</a> as a proposed contribution to Secret Network, and something Obscuro/Oasis etc could adopt. More details <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BYV_kMxGsgEHdDZhOlI8S0KtWhD_JZ0tHBeI4T1mTpc/edit">here</a>.
