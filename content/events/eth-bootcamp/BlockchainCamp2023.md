### The Hackathon 
Project teams self-selected projects on Monday after considering the project proposals. The teams coded throughout the week, and made project presentations and demos on Sunday. Six hackathon teams submitted projects this year. Projects were judged by Sarah Allen (IC3), Patrick McCorry (Arbitrum Foundation), and Surya Bakshi (Offchain Labs). The judging criteria were novelty, practicality, user experience, technical difficulty, and maturity of development within the week.

**Top 3 Projects:** 

<div class="ui piled segment">
    <img class="ui centered image" src="../images/events/blockchain-camp-2023/first.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="ui bottom attached message">
    <strong>First Place: "TEE"</strong><br>
    <strong>Team Members</strong>: Andrew Miller (project leader), Sylvain Bellemare (project leader), Gabriel Arrouye (project leader), Bunmi Akintade, Yunqi Li, James Austgen, Zhengxun Wu, Surya Bakshi, Swei Chen, Amber Seira, and Nerla Jean-Louis<br>
    <strong>Summary</strong>: TEE smart contracts like Secret, Oasis, Phala, Obscuro, are the hot new programming framework (see more details <a href="https://blockchainsplusx.github.io/">here</a>). Thereâ€™s an obstacle to providing privacy, which is the need to use ORAM or even a linear scan to avoid side channels. Read <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/378">SGXonerated</a>. Basically, Secret Network have not been able to provide strong privacy after the disclosure. Can we fix it? It turns out thereâ€™s a surprisingly simple way to use the existing programming models to provide off-chain computation, "Rolls ups for free using TEEs." Basically, we are using the integrity&privacy property of the TEE as a way to skip needing a zk Rollup or dispute period, etc. We used as a starting point the dockerized development environment from the SGXonerated paper. We could explore using Oasis instead of SN in two concurrent task forces.<br>
    <strong>Resources</strong>: This concept is described <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/tradeoffs-discussion-access-pattern-hiding-spicy-printfs/6884/15?u=amiller">here</a> as a proposed contribution to Secret Network, and something Obscuro/Oasis etc could adopt. More details <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BYV_kMxGsgEHdDZhOlI8S0KtWhD_JZ0tHBeI4T1mTpc/edit">here</a>.

    <div class="ui bottom attached message">
    <strong>First Place: "DECO"</strong><br>
    <strong>Team Members</strong>: Lorenz Breidenbach (project leader), Harjasleen Malvai (lproject leader), Alexandru Topliceanu (project leader), Ulisses Kee, Tom Yurek, Roi Bar-Zur, Marwa Moallem, Nihar Shah, Dahlia Malkhi, and Parth Gargava<br>
    <strong>Summary</strong>: In this project, we built an end-to-end system that allows users who satisfy certain criteria to obtain an identity and use it. In particular, we simulated a Chainlink DAO â€“ a governance smart contract handling voting. In our DAO, only users who are especially involved (as shown by their online interactions with Chainlink) with Chainlink and could even be called true believers ðŸ¦¹ can qualify to enroll. We used one or more external web sources to confirm how enthusiastic a user is about Chainlink, use these to generate attested credentials and finally, gather credentials to form identities. Those who are enthusiastic about Chainlink are obviously very smart and cool ðŸ˜Ž. So, like all cool people, they are both opinionated and privacy conscious â€“ they do not want to reveal personal information and they also do not want to reveal what they vote for, lest it be divisive. These privacy requirements pose interesting challenges!<br>

    <div class="ui bottom attached message">
    <strong>First Place: "EIP 1559"</strong><br>
    <strong>Team Members</strong>: Juan Pablo Madrigal Cianci (project leader), Chris Buckland, Abhimanyu Rawat, and Yuki Yuminaga<br>
    <strong>Summary</strong>: The recent surge in blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps) has laid bare the limitations of existing Ethereum transaction systems, thereby triggering a pressing demand for an efficient and predictable gas fee structure. The proposed project aims to address this challenge by integrating the EIP 1559 mechanism with gas lanes, an innovative approach to enhance transaction predictability and network scalability.<br>

**Additional Projects:**

***Metamath***

Team Members: Bolton Bailey (project leader), Jiasun Li, and Deepak Maram

Summary: There is a great potential for synergy between zero-knowledge proofs (which allow for succinct cryptographic checking of any computational statement) and formal proofs (which allow any mathematical statement to be checked computationally). In this project, we looked at using the many zero-knowledge codebases that have proliferated in the last few years to check Metamath, a language for formal theorem proving. Metamath has a variety of implementations (see <a href="https://us.metamath.org/other.html#verifiers">here</a>) and has the potential to be a good benchmark between systems, as well as being independently useful as a backend to many formal method projects.

***Unirep***

Team Members: Vivian Jeng (project leader), Chiali Tsai (project leader), Nico Serrano, and Joy Wang

Summary: UniRep is a zero-knowledge protocol that securely manages user data through anonymous identifiers, enabling trustless interactions and enhanced user privacy in applications. UniRep expands the notion of reputation to include various user data aspects, such as preferences, activity, alignments, and ownership. Using anonymous identifiers (epoch keys), The protocol allows for trustless engagement with applications while preserving user privacy. This approach promotes non-custodial applications that don't hold user data, reducing data breach risks and emphasizing security for both users and developers.

***Cross chain perpetuals***

Team Members: Dheeraj Chakilam (project leader), Haaroon Yousaf, Ali Farahbakhsh, Louis-Henri Merino, Abhay Khanna, Sean Wells, Kosala Yapa, and Shamseer Chettiyankandy

Summary: We used layer zero, axelar, hyperlane or another protocol to build a perpetual swap aggregator across chains.
