Join us for the 8th Annual IC3 Blockchain Camp! This 7-day experience will be hosted for the first time on the Cornell Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island, New York City, NY. Our Camp technical committee of Surya Bakshi, Haaroon Yousaf, Lorenz Breidenbach, and Patrick McCorry is preparing another immersive coding and learning experience. 

In addition to tech talks, panels and projects, we are planning social activities, games, birds-of-a-feather discussions, and more.

Topics will include DeFi, DAO, cryptography, Metaverse, NFTs, gaming and more! 

<strong> Please note that this is an IC3 members event, limited to current IC3 partners, academic members, fellows, and alumni. Some special exceptions will be made if capacity allows. Please reach out to Bria Han (<a href="mailto:jh2584@cornell.edu">jh2584@cornell.edu</a>) if you hope to qualify for an exception. </strong>

We will offer two overlapping tracks: a coding track and a presentation track.

<strong> Option 1 (Coding): </strong> The coding track includes all presentations, social activities, and participation in a weeklong coding project on a 5 - 10 person team. In the coding track, you can expect to engage with leaders in the blockchain community - faculty, architects, developers, students.

<strong> Option 2 (Presentation): </strong> The presentation track will be open to those who want to participate in camp events without joining a coding team.

Both tracks require pre-registration. Please use the <strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-mrUUoQhlbu9_-6iZ1o_F_VdgRSgef2Ry4O-jQXhXf5d3IA/viewform">registration form</a> </strong>. Those who register will receive additional details by email before the event.
