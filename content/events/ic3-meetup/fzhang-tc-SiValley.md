Fan Zhang is a PhD student in CS at Cornell studying  applied cryptography, cryptocurrencies and trusted hardware. He will speak on Town Crier: Smart contracts systems today lack trustworthy sources of data, as currently deployed oracles provide only weak provenance and confidentiality assurances. The Town Crier system leverages trusted hardware (Intel SGX) to provide a strong guarantee that data comes from an existing, trustworthy source. It also provides confidentiality, enabling smart contracts to support confidential queries and even manage user credentials.
