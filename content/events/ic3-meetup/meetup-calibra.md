**Abstract**

Dr. Dawn Song: In this talk, I will discuss the challenges facing our modern data economy, and how new technology and architectures can help individuals and businesses alike maintain privacy and control of their data. Today, data protection is done mainly through encryption at rest and in transit. When data is shared it's often copied, relying on contractual agreement for privacy enforcement - making it difficult to control usage. Finally, commonly used techniques like anonymization are often insufficient for protecting privacy. The result is a system where individuals have little control over how their information is used, and businesses struggle to break down data silos and comply with regulations. I will give an overview of how emerging privacy technology such as secure computing, differential privacy, distributed ledgers, and federated learning can be combined to create a secure distributed computing fabric that provides a foundation for a responsible data economy.

Dr. Sam Blackshear: In this talk, I will discuss the design and implementation of Move, an executable bytecode language for implementing custom transactions and "smart contracts" for the Libra blockchain. Move allows programmers to define custom *resource types* with semantics inspired by linear logic: a resource can never be copied or implicity discarded, only moved between program storage locations. First-class resources are a powerful primitive that programmers can use to create safe digital assets, write business logic for transferring assets, and enforce access control policies. The safety and expressivity of Move have enabled us to implement significant parts of the Libra protocol in the language. 


**Speakers**

Dawn Song is a Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley and the CEO of Oasis Labs. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, she was an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University from 2002 to 2007. Her research interest lies in security and privacy issues in computer systems. She is the recipient of many prestigious awards including the MacArthur Fellowship, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the MIT Technology Review TR-35 Award, and Best Paper Awards from top conferences. She is the founder of Ensighta Security Inc., which was acquired by FireEye Inc.

Sam Blackshear is a research scientist and tech lead at Calibra. He is the co-creator of the Move language and previously worked on the Infer static analyzer at Facebook. He is interested in applying techniques from programming languages research to build safe and simple systems. He earned his PhD from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2015. 


**About Calibra**

For many people around the world, basic financial services are still out of reach: about 1.7 billion adults globally remain unbanked. The cost of that exclusion is significant - $25 billion is lost by migrants every year through remittance fees. This is the challenge we're hoping to address with Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary whose goal is to provide people everywhere access to safe and affordable financial services through Libra, a new global payment system powered by blockchain technology. Our first product will be a digital wallet - Calibra - for Libra, and it will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app. 


**Arrival and Parking**

Some parking is available on site; however, it is limited. Please carpool or rideshare if possible. Upon arrival, please go to Building 20 Lobby 2 to check in with security.

Optional Shuttle: Valet and Self Parking is available at 1100 Hamilton Ct. Menlo Park, CA 94025. We will have a shuttle arrive at 5:30 and hold for 10 minutes and then return at 8:00 for those who wish to use this parking option. The shuttle will stop outside building 41 and have a sign mentioning the IC3 meetup.
